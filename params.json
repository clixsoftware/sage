{"name":"Sage","tagline":"ElasticSearch for node and the browser","body":"# sage [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mikepb/sage.png)](http://travis-ci.org/mikepb/sage)\r\n\r\nElasticSearch for node and the browser and sister project to [clerk][clerk]\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar sage = require('sage');\r\nvar client = sage('http://127.0.0.1:9200');\r\n\r\nclient.index('search').type('email').post({\r\n  title: 'Hello World!',\r\n  content: 'She sold sea shells on the sea shore.'\r\n}, function(err){\r\n\r\n  client.index('search').find({\r\n    query: { query_string: { query: 'shells' } }\r\n  }, function(err, data){\r\n    console.dir(data);\r\n  });\r\n\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npm install sage\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Experimental Browser Support\r\n\r\n`sage.js` and `sage.min.js` are the browser and minified browser versions of\r\nthe library. Modern browsers are generally supported, but not widely tested.\r\nThe `test/index.html` and `test/index-min.html` run the [mocha][mocha] tests\r\nin the browser.\r\n\r\nSecurity restrictions on cross-domain requests currently limits the usefulness\r\nof the browser version. Using a local proxy or configuring [Cross-Origin\r\nResource Sharing][cors] on a proxy in front of ElasticSearch may allow you to\r\nuse the library in the browser.\r\n\r\n## Philosophy\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of *sage* is to provide a thin wrapper around the ElasticSearch\r\nAPI, making the search engine easier to use from JavaScript. *sage* is\r\ndesigned to quickly allow you to get started with ElasticSearch. As you get\r\nmore comfortable with *sage* and Elasticsearch, *sage* gives you full access\r\nto ElasticSearch's more advanced features.\r\n\r\nThe library API generally follows the RESTful API, so you can use the\r\nElasticSearch docs as well as the *sage* docs to build your applications. If a\r\nfeature is missing from *sage* or you need to access more advanced features,\r\nthe `request` method allows you to send custom requests directly to\r\nElasticSearch.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright 2012 Michael Phan-Ba\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n<http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n\r\n[clerk]: https://github.com/mikepb/clerk\r\n[cors]: http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/\r\n[mocha]: http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
